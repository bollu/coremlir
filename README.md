# Core-MLIR

## Concerns about this `Graph` version of region

The code that looks like below is considered as a non-dominated use. So it
checks **use-sites**, not **def-sites**.

```cpp
standalone.module { 
standalone.dominance_free_scope {
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-Blocking dominance_free_scope
    vvvv-DEF
    %fib = standalone.toplevel_binding {  
        // ... standalone.dominance_free_scope { standalone.return (%fib) } ...
        ... standalone.return (%fib) } ...
                           USE-^^^^
    }
} // end dominance_free_scope
```

On the other hand, the code below is considered a dominated use (well, the domaintion
that is masked by `standalone.dominance_free_scope`:

```cpp
standalone.module { 
// standalone.dominance_free_scope {

    vvvv-DEF
    %fib = standalone.toplevel_binding {  
        ... standalone.dominance_free_scope { standalone.return (%fib) } ...
   BLOCKING-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                 USE-^^^^
        //... standalone.return (%fib) } ...
                                    
    }
//} // end dominance_free_scope
```

So, abstractly, the version below round-trips through MLIR. I will denote
this as `DEF(BLOCKING(USE))`:

```
DEF-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
   BLOCKING----------->
     | USE-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
     |
     v
```

The one below (denoted as `BLOCKING(DEF(USE)))`) does not
round-trip through MLIR; It gives domination errors:

```
BLOCKING----------->
|DEF-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
|   USE-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
|    
v    
```

- My mental model of the "blocking" was off! I thought it meant that
  everything inside this region can disobey SSA conditions. Rather,
  it means that everything **inside** this region can disobey SSA _with respect to_
  everything **outside** this region. [Maybe the other way round as well, I have not tried,
  nor do I have a good mental model of this].


- Unfortunately, for `Core`, it is the latter version with `BLOCKING (DEF (USE))` that 
  is of more use, since the `Core` encoding encodes the recursion as:

```
rec { -- BLOCKING
  fib :: Int -> Int
  
  {- Core Size{terms=23 types=6 cos=0 vbinds=0 jbinds=0} -}
  fib = -- DEF-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
    λ i →
       ...
      (APP(Main.fib i)) -- USE-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
      ...
}
```

So when we translate from `Core` into MLIR, we need to either
figure out which are the bindings that are `use-before-def` and then wrap them.
Or we participate in the discussion and petition for this kind of "lazy-region"
as well. Maybe both.

## Stuff discovered in this process about `ghc-dump`:

##### Fib for reference

```hs
{- Core Size{terms=23 types=6 cos=0 vbinds=0 jbinds=0} -}
fib = λ i → case i of wild {
    I# ds →
      case ds of ds {
        DEFAULT →
          APP(GHC.Num.+ @Int GHC.Num.$fNumInt // fib(i-1) + fib(i)
            (APP(Main.fib i)) // fib(i)
            (APP(Main.fib  -- fib(i - 1)
                    APP(GHC.Num.- @Int GHC.Num.$fNumInt i (APP(GHC.Types.I# 1#))))))) -- (i - 1)
        0# → APP(GHC.Types.I# 0#)
        1# → APP(GHC.Types.I# 1#)
      }
  }
```
I feel that `ghc-dump` does not preserve all the information we want. Hence
I started hand-writing the IR we want. I'll finish the translator after
I sleep and wake up. However, it's unclear to me how much extending `ghc-dump`
makes sense. I should maybe clean-slate from a Core plugin.


- Why? Because `ghc-dump` does not retain enough information. For example,
  it treats both `GHC.Num.$fNumInt` and `GHC.Types.I#` as variables; It has
  erased the fact that one is a typeclass dictionary and the other is
  a data constructor.

- Similarly, there is no way to query from within `ghc-dump` what `GHC.Num.-`
  is, and it's impossible to infer from context.

- In general, this is full of unknown-unknowns for me. I don't know enough 
  of the details of core to forsee what we will may need from GHC. Using
  `ghc-dump` is a bad idea because it's technical debt against a 
  _prettyprinter of core_ (fundamentally).

- Hence, we should really be reusing the
  [code in `ghc-dump` that traverses `Core` from within GHC](https://github.com/bgamari/ghc-dump/blob/master/ghc-dump-core/GhcDump/Convert.hs#L237).


# 1 July 2020

- [Reading GHC core sources paid off, the `CorePrep` invariants are documented here](https://haskell-code-explorer.mfix.io/package/ghc-8.6.1/show/coreSyn/CorePrep.hs#L142)
- In particular we have `case <body> of`. So nested cases are legal, 
  which is something we need to flatten.
- Outside of nested cases, everything else seems "reasonable": laziness is
  at each point of `let`. We can lower `let var = e` as `%let_var = lazy(e)`
  for example.
- Will first transcribe our `fibstrict` example by hand, then write a small
  Core plugin to do this automagically.
- I don't understand WTF `cabal` is doing. In particular, why `cabal install --library`
  installs the library twice :(
- It _seems_ like the cabal documentation on [how to install a system library](https://downloads.haskell.org/~cabal/Cabal-latest/doc/users-guide/installing-packages.html#building-and-installing-a-system-package)
  should do the trick.

```hs
$ runghc Setup.hs configure --ghc
$ runghc Setup.hs build
$ runghc Setup.hs install
```

- OK, so the problem was that I somehow had `cabal` hidden in my package management.
  It turns that even `ghc-pkg` maintains a local and a global package directory,
  and I was exposing stuff in my _local_ package directory (which is in `~/.ghc/.../package.conf.d`),
  note the global one (which is in `/usr/lib/ghc-6.12.1/package.conf.d`).
- The solution is to ask `ghc-pkg --global expose Cabal` which exposes `cabal`,
  which contains `Distribution.Simple`, which is needed to run `Setup.hs`.
- `runghc` is some kind of wrapper around `ghc` runs a file directly without
  having to compile things.
- Of course, this is disjoint from `cabal`'s `exposed-modules`, which is a layer
  disjoint from `ghc-pkg`. I think cabal commands `ghc-pkg` to expose and hide
  what it needs. This is fucking hilarious if it weren't so complex.

- To quote the GHC manual on `Cabal`'s `Distribution.Simple`:

> This module isn't called "Simple" because it's simple. Far from it. It's
> called "Simple" because it does complicated things to simple software.
> The original idea was that there could be different build systems that all
> presented the same compatible command line interfaces. There is still a
> Distribution.Make system but in practice no packages use it.
> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Cabal-3.2.0.0/docs/Distribution-Simple.html


Reading GHC sources can sometimes be unpleasant. There are many, many invariants
to be maintained. [This is from CorePrep.hs:1450](https://haskell-code-explorer.mfix.io/package/ghc-8.6.1/show/coreSyn/CorePrep.hs#L1450):

> There is a subtle but important invariant ...
> The solution is CorePrep to have a miniature inlining pass...
> Why does the removal of 'lazy' have to occur in CorePrep? he gory details are in Note [lazyId magic]...
> We decided not to adopt this solution to keep the definition of 'exprIsTrivial' simple....
> There is ONE caveat however...
> the (hacky) non-recursive -- binding for data constructors...

- Brilliant, my tooling suddenly died thanks to https://github.com/well-typed/cborg/issues/242: GHC Prim
  and `cborg` started overlapping an export. 


- [`cabal install --lib` is not idempotent](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6394).
  Only haskellers would have issue citing a problem about **library installs**,
  while describing the issue as one of **idempotence**.

# 3 July 2020 (Friday)

Got the basic examples converted to SSA. Trying to do this in a GHC plugin.
Most of the translation code works. I'm stuck at a point, though. I need
to rename a variable `GHC.Num.-#` into something that can be named. Otherwise,
I try to create the MLIR:

```
%app_100  =  hask.apSSA(%-#, %i_s1wH)
```

where the `-#` refers to the variable name `GHC.Num.-#`. This is pretty
ludicrous. However, attempting to get a name from GHC seems quite complicated.
There are things like:

- `Id`
- `Var`
- `class NamedThing`
- `data OccName`

it's quite confusing as to what does what.

# 7 July 2020 (Tuesday)

- `mkUniqueGrimily`: great name for a function that creates data.
