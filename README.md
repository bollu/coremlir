# Core-MLIR

## Concerns about this `Graph` version of region

The code that looks like below is considered as a non-dominated use. So it
checks **use-sites**, not **def-sites**.

```cpp
standalone.module { 
standalone.dominance_free_scope {
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-Blocking dominance_free_scope
    vvvv-DEF
    %fib = standalone.toplevel_binding {  
        // ... standalone.dominance_free_scope { standalone.return (%fib) } ...
        ... standalone.return (%fib) } ...
                           USE-^^^^
    }
} // end dominance_free_scope
```

On the other hand, the code below is considered a dominated use (well, the domaintion
that is masked by `standalone.dominance_free_scope`:

```cpp
standalone.module { 
// standalone.dominance_free_scope {

    vvvv-DEF
    %fib = standalone.toplevel_binding {  
        ... standalone.dominance_free_scope { standalone.return (%fib) } ...
   BLOCKING-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                 USE-^^^^
        //... standalone.return (%fib) } ...
                                    
    }
//} // end dominance_free_scope
```

So, abstractly, the version below round-trips through MLIR. I will denote
this as `DEF(BLOCKING(USE))`:

```
DEF-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
   BLOCKING----------->
     | USE-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
     |
     v
```

The one below (denoted as `BLOCKING(DEF(USE)))`) does not
round-trip through MLIR; It gives domination errors:

```
BLOCKING----------->
|DEF-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
|   USE-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
|    
v    
```

- My mental model of the "blocking" was off! I thought it meant that
  everything inside this region can disobey SSA conditions. Rather,
  it means that everything **inside** this region can disobey SSA _with respect to_
  everything **outside** this region. [Maybe the other way round as well, I have not tried,
  nor do I have a good mental model of this].


- Unfortunately, for `Core`, it is the latter version with `BLOCKING (DEF (USE))` that 
  is of more use, since the `Core` encoding encodes the recursion as:

```
rec { -- BLOCKING
  fib :: Int -> Int
  
  {- Core Size{terms=23 types=6 cos=0 vbinds=0 jbinds=0} -}
  fib = -- DEF-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
    λ i →
       ...
      (APP(Main.fib i)) -- USE-MUTUAL-RECURSIVE
      ...
}
```

So when we translate from `Core` into MLIR, we need to either
figure out which are the bindings that are `use-before-def` and then wrap them.
Or we participate in the discussion and petition for this kind of "lazy-region"
as well. Maybe both.

## Stuff discovered in this process about `ghc-dump`:

##### Fib for reference

```hs
{- Core Size{terms=23 types=6 cos=0 vbinds=0 jbinds=0} -}
fib = λ i → case i of wild {
    I# ds →
      case ds of ds {
        DEFAULT →
          APP(GHC.Num.+ @Int GHC.Num.$fNumInt // fib(i-1) + fib(i)
            (APP(Main.fib i)) // fib(i)
            (APP(Main.fib  -- fib(i - 1)
                    APP(GHC.Num.- @Int GHC.Num.$fNumInt i (APP(GHC.Types.I# 1#))))))) -- (i - 1)
        0# → APP(GHC.Types.I# 0#)
        1# → APP(GHC.Types.I# 1#)
      }
  }
```
I feel that `ghc-dump` does not preserve all the information we want. Hence
I started hand-writing the IR we want. I'll finish the translator after
I sleep and wake up. However, it's unclear to me how much extending `ghc-dump`
makes sense. I should maybe clean-slate from a Core plugin.


- Why? Because `ghc-dump` does not retain enough information. For example,
  it treats both `GHC.Num.$fNumInt` and `GHC.Types.I#` as variables; It has
  erased the fact that one is a typeclass dictionary and the other is
  a data constructor.

- Similarly, there is no way to query from within `ghc-dump` what `GHC.Num.-`
  is, and it's impossible to infer from context.

- In general, this is full of unknown-unknowns for me. I don't know enough 
  of the details of core to forsee what we will may need from GHC. Using
  `ghc-dump` is a bad idea because it's technical debt against a 
  _prettyprinter of core_ (fundamentally).

- Hence, we should really be reusing the
  [code in `ghc-dump` that traverses `Core` from within GHC](https://github.com/bgamari/ghc-dump/blob/master/ghc-dump-core/GhcDump/Convert.hs#L237).


# 1 July 2020

- [Reading GHC core sources paid off, the `CorePrep` invariants are documented here](https://haskell-code-explorer.mfix.io/package/ghc-8.6.1/show/coreSyn/CorePrep.hs#L142)
- In particular we have `case <body> of`. So nested cases are legal, 
  which is something we need to flatten.
- Outside of nested cases, everything else seems "reasonable": laziness is
  at each point of `let`. We can lower `let var = e` as `%let_var = lazy(e)`
  for example.
- Will first transcribe our `fibstrict` example by hand, then write a small
  Core plugin to do this automagically.
- I don't understand WTF `cabal` is doing. In particular, why `cabal install --library`
  installs the library twice :(
- It _seems_ like the cabal documentation on [how to install a system library](https://downloads.haskell.org/~cabal/Cabal-latest/doc/users-guide/installing-packages.html#building-and-installing-a-system-package)
  should do the trick.

```hs
$ runghc Setup.hs configure --ghc
$ runghc Setup.hs build
$ runghc Setup.hs install
```

- OK, so the problem was that I somehow had `cabal` hidden in my package management.
  It turns that even `ghc-pkg` maintains a local and a global package directory,
  and I was exposing stuff in my _local_ package directory (which is in `~/.ghc/.../package.conf.d`),
  note the global one (which is in `/usr/lib/ghc-6.12.1/package.conf.d`).
- The solution is to ask `ghc-pkg --global expose Cabal` which exposes `cabal`,
  which contains `Distribution.Simple`, which is needed to run `Setup.hs`.
- `runghc` is some kind of wrapper around `ghc` runs a file directly without
  having to compile things.
- Of course, this is disjoint from `cabal`'s `exposed-modules`, which is a layer
  disjoint from `ghc-pkg`. I think cabal commands `ghc-pkg` to expose and hide
  what it needs. This is fucking hilarious if it weren't so complex.

- To quote the GHC manual on `Cabal`'s `Distribution.Simple`:

> This module isn't called "Simple" because it's simple. Far from it. It's
> called "Simple" because it does complicated things to simple software.
> The original idea was that there could be different build systems that all
> presented the same compatible command line interfaces. There is still a
> Distribution.Make system but in practice no packages use it.
> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Cabal-3.2.0.0/docs/Distribution-Simple.html


Reading GHC sources can sometimes be unpleasant. There are many, many invariants
to be maintained. [This is from CorePrep.hs:1450](https://haskell-code-explorer.mfix.io/package/ghc-8.6.1/show/coreSyn/CorePrep.hs#L1450):

> There is a subtle but important invariant ...
> The solution is CorePrep to have a miniature inlining pass...
> Why does the removal of 'lazy' have to occur in CorePrep? he gory details are in Note [lazyId magic]...
> We decided not to adopt this solution to keep the definition of 'exprIsTrivial' simple....
> There is ONE caveat however...
> the (hacky) non-recursive -- binding for data constructors...

- Brilliant, my tooling suddenly died thanks to https://github.com/well-typed/cborg/issues/242: GHC Prim
  and `cborg` started overlapping an export. 


- [`cabal install --lib` is not idempotent](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6394).
  Only haskellers would have issue citing a problem about **library installs**,
  while describing the issue as one of **idempotence**.

# 3 July 2020 (Friday)

Got the basic examples converted to SSA. Trying to do this in a GHC plugin.
Most of the translation code works. I'm stuck at a point, though. I need
to rename a variable `GHC.Num.-#` into something that can be named. Otherwise,
I try to create the MLIR:

```
%app_100  =  hask.apSSA(%-#, %i_s1wH)
```

where the `-#` refers to the variable name `GHC.Num.-#`. This is pretty
ludicrous. However, attempting to get a name from GHC seems quite complicated.
There are things like:

- `Id`
- `Var`
- `class NamedThing`
- `data OccName`

it's quite confusing as to what does what.

# 7 July 2020 (Tuesday)

- `mkUniqueGrimily`: great name for a function that creates data.
- OK, good, we now have MLIR that round-trips, in the sense that our
  MLIR gets verified. Now we have undeclared SSA variable problems:

```

Note that all of these names are GHC internals. We need to:
- Process all names, figure out what are our 'external' references.
- Code-generate 'extern' stubs for all of these.

There is also going to be the annoying "recursive call does not dominate use"
problem badgering us. We'll have to analyze Core to decide which use site is
recursive. This entire enterprise is messy, messy business.

The GHC sources are confusing. Consider `Util/Bag.hs`. We have `filterBagM` which
seems like an odd operation to have becuse a `Bag` is supposed to be unordered.
Nor does the function have any users at any rate. Spoke to Ben about it,
he said it's fine to delete the function, so I'll send a PR to do that once
I get this up and running...

# Wednesday, 8th july

- change my codegen so that regular variables are not uniqued, only wilds. This
  gives us stable names for things like `fib`, `runMain`, rather than names like `fib_X1` 
  or whatever. That will allow me to hardcode the preamble I need to build a
  vertical proptotype. This is also what Core seems to do:

```hs
Rec {
-- RHS size: {terms: 21, types: 4, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
fib [Occ=LoopBreaker] :: Int# -> Int#
[LclId]
fib -- the name fib is not uniqued
  = \ (i_a12E :: Int#) ->  -- this lambda variable is uniqued
      case i_a12E of {
        __DEFAULT ->
          case fib (-# i_a12E 1#) of wild_00 { __DEFAULT ->
          (case fib i_a12E of wild_X5 { __DEFAULT -> +# wild_X5 }) wild_00
          };
        0# -> i_a12E;
        1# -> i_a12E
      }
end Rec }

-- RHS size: {terms: 5, types: 0, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
$trModule :: Module
[LclIdX]
$trModule = Module (TrNameS "main"#) (TrNameS "Main"#)

-- RHS size: {terms: 7, types: 3, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
main
  = case fib 10# of { __DEFAULT -> return @ IO $fMonadIO @ () () }

-- RHS size: {terms: 2, types: 1, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
main = runMainIO @ () main

```

Note that only parameters to lambdas and wilds are `unique`d. Toplevel names
are not. I need some sane way in the code to figure out what I should unique
and what I should not by reading the Core pretty printing properly.

- There is a bigger problem. Note that the Core appears to have ** two `main` ** 
  declarations. I have no idea WTF is the semantics of this.

- OK, names are now fixed. I call the underlying `Outputable` instance of `Var` that knows the 
  right thing to do in all contexts. I didn't do this earlier because it prints
  functions as `-#`, `+#`, `()`, etc. So I intercept these. The implementation
  is 4 lines, but figuring it out took half an hour :/. This entire enterprise
  is like this.

```hs
-- use the ppr of Var because it knows whether to print or not.
cvtVar :: Var -> SDoc
cvtVar v = 
	let name = unpackFS $ occNameFS $ getOccName v
	in if name == "-#" then  (text "%minus_hash")
  	   else if name == "+#" then (text "%plus_hash")
  	   else if name == "()" then (text "%unit_tuple")
  	   else text "%" >< ppr v 
```


##### Re-checking the dumps from `fibstrict.hs`

OK, so I decided to view the dump from the horse's mouth:

```hs
-- | fibstrict.hs
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}
import GHC.Prim
fib :: Int# -> Int#
fib i = case i of
        0# ->  i; 1# ->  i
        _ ->  (fib i) +# (fib (i -# 1#))
main :: IO (); main = let x = fib 10# in return ()
```

```Core
-- | generated from fibstrict.hs
==================== Desugar (after optimization) ====================
2020-07-08 16:31:29.998915479 UTC
...

-- RHS size: {terms: 7, types: 3, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
main
  = case fib 10# of { __DEFAULT ->
    return @ IO GHC.Base.$fMonadIO @ () GHC.Tuple.()
    }

-- | what is this :Main.main?
-- RHS size: {terms: 2, types: 1, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
:Main.main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
:Main.main = GHC.TopHandler.runMainIO @ () main

```

Note that there is `main`, and then there is `:Main.main` [So there is an extra `:Main.`].
This appears to inform the difference. One of them is some kind of top handler
that is added automagically. I might have to strip this from my printing.
I need to see how to deal with this. Will first identify what adds this symbol
and if there's a clean way to disable this.

- TODO: figure out how to get the core dump that I print in my MLIR file
  to contain as much information as the GHC dump. for example,
  the GHC dump says:

```
-- ***GHC file fibstrict.dump-ds***
-- RHS size: {terms: 2, types: 1, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
:Main.main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
:Main.main = GHC.TopHandler.runMainIO @ () main

```

```
-- ***my MLIR file with the Core appended to the end as a comment***
-- RHS size: {terms: 2, types: 1, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
main = runMainIO @ () main

```
- In particular, note that `fibstrict.dump-ds` says `:Main.main = GHC.TopHandler.runMainIO` while my
  MLIR file only says `main = runMainIO ...`. I want that full qualification
  in my dump as well. I will spend some time on this, because the upshot
  is **huge**: accurate debugging and names!

- The GHC codebase is written with misery as a resource, it seems:

```hs
-- compiler/GHC/Rename/Env.hs
        -- We can get built-in syntax showing up here too, sadly.  If you type
        --      data T = (,,,)
        -- the constructor is parsed as a type, and then GHC.Parser.PostProcess.tyConToDataCon
        -- uses setRdrNameSpace to make it into a data constructors.  At that point
        -- the nice Exact name for the TyCon gets swizzled to an Orig name.
        -- Hence the badOrigBinding error message.
        --
        -- Except for the ":Main.main = ..." definition inserted into
        -- the Main module; ugh!
```

Ugh indeed. I have no idea how to check if the binder is `:Main.main`

- What I do know is that this is built here:

```
compiler/GHC/Tc/Module.hs
-- See Note [Root-main Id]
-- Construct the binding
--      :Main.main :: IO res_ty = runMainIO res_ty main
; run_main_id <- tcLookupId runMainIOName
; let { root_main_name =  mkExternalName rootMainKey rOOT_MAIN
                   (mkVarOccFS (fsLit "main"))
                   (getSrcSpan main_name)
; root_main_id = Id.mkExportedVanillaId root_main_name
                                      (mkTyConApp ioTyCon [res_ty])
```

After which I have no _fucking_ clue how to check that the binding
comes from this module.

The note reads:

```
Note [Root-main Id]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The function that the RTS invokes is always :Main.main, which we call
root_main_id.  (Because GHC allows the user to have a module not
called Main as the main module, we can't rely on the main function
being called "Main.main".  That's why root_main_id has a fixed module
":Main".)

This is unusual: it's a LocalId whose Name has a Module from another
module. Tiresomely, we must filter it out again in GHC.Iface.Make, less we
get two defns for 'main' in the interface file!
```

# Monday, 13th july

- Added a new type `hask.untyped` to represent all things in my hask dialect.
  This was mostly to future proof and ensure that stuff is not
  accidentally wrecked by my use of `none`.

## how is `FuncOp` implemented?

How the funcOp gets parsed:

- Toplevel: It calls `parseFunctionLikeOp`. They use `PIMPL` style here for whatever
  reason.

- https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/74145d584126da2ce7a836d9b2240d56442f3ea1/mlir/lib/IR/Function.cpp

```cpp
ParseResult FuncOp::parse(OpAsmParser &parser, OperationState &result) {
  auto buildFuncType = [](Builder &builder, ArrayRef<Type> argTypes,
                          ArrayRef<Type> results, impl::VariadicFlag,
                          std::string &) {
    return builder.getFunctionType(argTypes, results);
  };

  return impl::parseFunctionLikeOp(parser, result, /*allowVariadic=*/false,
                                   buildFuncType);
}
```

- the call to `parseFunctioLikeOp` does bog-standard stuff. The interesting
  bit is that it parses the function name as a _symbol_ (attribute). so the
  syntax `func foo` has `func` as a keyword, with `foo` being a symbol.

- Now I'm confused as to how this prevents "double declarations" of the same
  function. is this verified by the module after as a separate check, and
  not encoded as SSA? If so, that's fugly.

- https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/5eae715a3115be2640d0fd37d0bd4771abf2ab9b/mlir/lib/IR/FunctionImplementation.cpp#L160
```cpp
ParseResult
mlir::impl::parseFunctionLikeOp(OpAsmParser &parser, OperationState &result,
                                bool allowVariadic,
                                mlir::impl::FuncTypeBuilder funcTypeBuilder) {
  SmallVector<OpAsmParser::OperandType, 4> entryArgs;
  SmallVector<NamedAttrList, 4> argAttrs;
  SmallVector<NamedAttrList, 4> resultAttrs;
  SmallVector<Type, 4> argTypes;
  SmallVector<Type, 4> resultTypes;
  auto &builder = parser.getBuilder();

  // Parse the name as a symbol.
  StringAttr nameAttr;
  if (parser.parseSymbolName(nameAttr, ::mlir::SymbolTable::getSymbolAttrName(),
                             result.attributes))
    return failure();

  // Parse the function signature.
  auto signatureLocation = parser.getCurrentLocation();
  bool isVariadic = false;
  if (parseFunctionSignature(parser, allowVariadic, entryArgs, argTypes,
                             argAttrs, isVariadic, resultTypes, resultAttrs))
    return failure();

  std::string errorMessage;
  if (auto type = funcTypeBuilder(builder, argTypes, resultTypes,
                                  impl::VariadicFlag(isVariadic), errorMessage))
    result.addAttribute(getTypeAttrName(), TypeAttr::get(type));    
  else
    return parser.emitError(signatureLocation)
           << "failed to construct function type"
           << (errorMessage.empty() ? "" : ": ") << errorMessage;

  // If function attributes are present, parse them.
  if (parser.parseOptionalAttrDictWithKeyword(result.attributes))
    return failure();

  // Add the attributes to the function arguments.
  assert(argAttrs.size() == argTypes.size());
  assert(resultAttrs.size() == resultTypes.size());
  addArgAndResultAttrs(builder, result, argAttrs, resultAttrs);

  // Parse the optional function body.
  auto *body = result.addRegion();
  return parser.parseOptionalRegion(
      *body, entryArgs, entryArgs.empty() ? ArrayRef<Type>() : argTypes);
}
```

##### How `call` works:

- FML, tobias was right. I was hoping he was not. It is indeed true that the
  function name argument is a string :/ So then, how does one walk the
  use chain when one hits a function?

  let arguments = (ins FlatSymbolRefAttr:$callee, Variadic<AnyType>:$operands);
  let results = (outs Variadic<AnyType>);

  let builders = [OpBuilder<
    "OpBuilder &builder, OperationState &result, FuncOp callee,"
    "ValueRange operands = {}", [{
      result.addOperands(operands);
      result.addAttribute("callee", builder.getSymbolRefAttr(callee));

    /// Get the argument operands to the called function.

- What is a `FlatSymbolRefAttr` you ask? excellent question.
- https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/9db53a182705ac1f652c6ee375735bea5539272c/mlir/include/mlir/IR/Attributes.h#L551
- OK, so it's not a string! It's a `symbolName`, as parsed by `parseSymbolName`.


```cpp
 /// A symbol reference attribute represents a symbolic reference to another
 /// operation.
 class SymbolRefAttr
    : public Attribute::AttrBase<SymbolRefAttr, Attribute,
                                 detail::SymbolRefAttributeStorage> {
```

- symbols are explained in MLIR as follows, at the 'Symbols and symbol tables' doc: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/9db53a182705ac1f652c6ee375735bea5539272c/mlir/docs/SymbolsAndSymbolTables.md

> A Symbol is a named operation that resides immediately within a region that
> defines a SymbolTable. The name of a symbol must be unique within the parent
> SymbolTable. This name is semantically similarly to an SSA result value, and
> may be referred to by other operations to provide a symbolic link, or use, to
> the symbol. An example of a Symbol operation is func. func defines a symbol
> name, which is referred to by operations like `std.call`.

- It continues, talking explicitly about SSA:

> Using an attribute, as opposed to an SSA value, has several benefits:
>
> If we were to use SSA values, we would need to create some mechanism in which
> to opt-out of certain properties of it such as dominance. Attributes allow
> for referencing the operations irregardless of the order in which they were
> defined.
>
> Attributes simplify referencing operations within nested symbol tables, which
> are traditionally not visible outside of the parent region.

- OK, nice, this is not fugly! Great `:D` I am so releived.

##### How `ret` works:

- https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/mlir/include/mlir/Dialect/StandardOps/IR/Ops.td#L2063

```cpp
 def ReturnOp : Std_Op<"return", [NoSideEffect, HasParent<"FuncOp">, ReturnLike,
                                 Terminator]> {
  ...

  let arguments = (ins Variadic<AnyType>:$operands);
  let builders = [OpBuilder<
    "OpBuilder &b, OperationState &result", [{ build(b, result, llvm::None); }]
  >];
  let assemblyFormat = "attr-dict ($operands^ `:` type($operands))?";
}
```

### Can we use the `recursive_ref` construct to encode `fib` more simply?

Yes we can. We can write, for example:

```mlir
hask.module { 
    %fib = hask.recursive_ref  {  
        %core_one =  hask.make_i32(1)
        %fib_call = hask.apSSA(%fib, %core_one) <- use does not dominate def
        hask.return(%fib_call)
    }
    hask.return(%fib)
}
```

and this "just works".

**EDIT**: Nope, NVM. I implemented this and found out that this _does not work_:

```mlir
hask.module { 
    %core_one =  hask.make_i32(1)

    // passes
    %flat = hask.recursive_ref  {  
        %fib_call = hask.apSSA(%flat, %core_one)
        hask.return(%fib_call)
    }

    // fails!
    %nested = hask.recursive_ref  {  
        %case = hask.caseSSA %core_one 
                ["default" -> { //default
                    // fails because the use is nested inside a region.
                    %fib_call = hask.apSSA(%nested, %core_one)
                    hask.return(%fib_call)
                }]
        hask.return(%case)
    }
    hask.dummy_finish
}
```

- In particular, note that the `%nested` use fails. This is because the use
  is wrapped inside a normal region of the `default` block. This normal
  region again establishes SSA rules.


### Email to GHC-devs about how to use names


I'm trying to understand how to query information about `Var`s from a
Core plugin. Consider the snippet of haskell:

```
{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}
import GHC.Prim
fib :: Int# -> Int#
fib i = case i of 0# ->  i; 1# ->  i; _ ->  (fib i) +# (fib (i -# 1#))

main :: IO (); main = let x = fib 10# in return ()
```

That compiles to the following (elided) GHC Core, dumped right after desugar:

```mlir
Rec {
fib [Occ=LoopBreaker] :: Int# -> Int#
[LclId]
fib
  = \ (i_a12E :: Int#) ->
      case i_a12E of {
        __DEFAULT ->
          case fib (-# i_a12E 1#) of wild_00 { __DEFAULT ->
          (case fib i_a12E of wild_X5 { __DEFAULT -> +# wild_X5 }) wild_00
          };
        0# -> i_a12E;
        1# -> i_a12E
      }
end Rec }

Main.$trModule :: GHC.Types.Module
[LclIdX]
Main.$trModule
  = GHC.Types.Module
      (GHC.Types.TrNameS "main"#) (GHC.Types.TrNameS "Main"#)

-- RHS size: {terms: 7, types: 3, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
main
  = case fib 10# of { __DEFAULT ->
    return @ IO GHC.Base.$fMonadIO @ () GHC.Tuple.()
    }

-- RHS size: {terms: 2, types: 1, coercions: 0, joins: 0/0}
:Main.main :: IO ()
[LclIdX]
:Main.main = GHC.TopHandler.runMainIO @ () main
```

I've been  using `occNameString . getOccName :: Id -> String` to detect names from a `Var`
. I'm rapidly finding this insufficient, and want more information
about a variable. In particular, How to I figure out:

1. When I see the Var with occurence name `fib`, that it belongs to module `Main`?
2. When I see the Var with name `main`, whether it is `Main.main` or `:Main.main`?
3. When I see the Var with name `+#`, that this is an inbuilt name? Similarly
   for `-#` and `()`.
4. In general, given a Var, how do I decide where it comes from, and whether it is
   user-defined or something GHC defined ('wired-in' I believe is the term I am
   looking for)?
5. When I see a `Var`, how do I learn its type?
6. In general, is there a page that tells me how to 'query' Core/`ModGuts` from within a core plugin?


### Answers to email [Where to find name info]:

- I received one answer (so far) that told me to look at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.10.1/docs/Name.html#g:3
- In `haskell-code-explorer`: https://haskell-code-explorer.mfix.io/package/ghc-8.6.1/show/basicTypes/Name.hs#L107

- The link seems to contain answers to some of my questions, but not others. I
  had tried some of the APIs among them, and didn't understand their semantics.
  But it's at least comforting to know that I was looking at the right place.

- Another  file that might be useful: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.10.1/docs/Module.html#t:Module
- In `haskell-code-exporer`: https://haskell-code-explorer.mfix.io/package/ghc-8.6.1/show/basicTypes/Module.hs#L407

### Trying to use `SymbolAttr` for implementing functions

- The problem appears to be that something like `@foo` is not considered an SSA value, but a `SymbolAttr`
  So what is the "type" of my function `apSSA`? does it take first parameter an SSA value?
  or does it take first parameter `SymbolAttr`? I need both!

```mlir
// foo :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
func @foo() {
  ... 
  %ret = hask.ap(@foo, 1) // recursive call
  hask.ap(%ret, 1) // 
}
```

Possible solutions:
1. Make the call of two types: `callToplevel`, and `callOther`. This is against the ethos of haskell.
2. Continue using our `reucrsive_ref` hack that lets us treat toplevel bindings uniformly.
3. Use MLIR hackery to have `call(...)` take first parameter _either_ `FlatSymbolAttr` _or_ an SSA value.
   It seems that this is sub-optimal, which is why the `std` dialect seems to have both `call`
   and `indirect_call`.

- `call`: https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/Standard/#stdcall-callop. Has attribute `callee`
  of type `::mlir::FlatSymbolRefAttr`

- `call_indirect`: https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/Standard/#stdcall_indirect-callindirectop Has operand `callee` of type `function type`.

This will lead to pain, because we have a `SymbolAttr` and an SSA value with the
same name, like so:

```mlir
// This is hopeless, we can have SSA values and symbol table entries with
// the same name.
hask.func @function {
    %function = hask.make_i32(1)
    hask.return (%function)
}
```

This round trips through MLIR `:(`. Big sad.
